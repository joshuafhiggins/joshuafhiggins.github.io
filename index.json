As well as a basis for mod loading. But for this week, I didn’t do much (less than I wanted to) but I did do research into physics, cameras, model loading, and entity component systems/ECS.

The mesh class makes a bunch of BufferObjects that hold the OpenGL pointers and have base functions for cleanup. This allows very easy derivatives of the Mesh class for whatever they needed. public class FooMesh extends Mesh { //... @Override public void Create() { //Make our VAO VAO = new BufferObject.VAO(); VAO.Bind(); //Array of non specific BufferObjects bufferObjects[0] = new BufferObject.VBO(vertices, 0); //Static classes that inherit BufferObject. //These are binded and attached with no intervention bufferObjects[1] = new BufferObject.CBO(vertices, 1); bufferObjects[2] = new BufferObject.TBO(vertices, 2); IBO = new BufferObject.IBO(indices); VAO.Unbind(); } //... //Rendering, method calls are pretty self explanatory. //Inputs aren't final. //I'm not happy with the Entity being passed in for rendering when Entity's hold meshes public void Render(Entity entity, Camera camera) { VAO.Bind(); enableVertexAttrib(); IBO.Bind(); material.Bind(); shader.Bind(); SetUniforms(entity, camera); DrawElements(); shader.Unbind(); material.Unbind(); IBO.Unbind(); disableVertexAttrib(); VAO.Unbind(); } } Derivatives were made when going through the tutorials but were ultimately removed for the approach of having a better base because having a different Mesh for color and then for texture and then color, but color is never used… It was just a headache for general refactoring and keeping them up to date. A lot of buffer stuff was taken from TF2 in Java \u0026 OpenGL.

I want the Material class to hold all of the textures without order and you leave it to modders to make their shaders and textures line up. I’m only using SlickUtil right now because of the ability to load Textures from class resources rather than the file path. But I’m ultimately going to replace it with my one Texture class because of the [model loader](#Model Loading) not using class resources. Supposedly we can load from resources, and call the function to load model from memory or textures from memory with STB, but I have no idea what the size of the buffers should be.

Once I did this, it kinda made me think about what next. I thought I should focus on an ECS system for holding positions, rotations, etc. which right now is the Entity class that should be derived from but will change (see the ECS section). This was kind of the thing that spun off into the unproductive week. Although this was not easy at all because the shader was originally going from different matrices in the wrong order. //... uniform mat4 model; uniform mat4 view; uniform mat4 projection; void main() { //How it should be: //gl_Position = vec4(position, 1.0) * model * view * projection; gl_Position = projection * view * model * vec4(position, 1.0); //... } But here it is now working just right: Smiley looking better now\r","date":"2021-08-08","objectID":"/butter-dejavu/:3:0","tags":["Butter Engine","Update","Programming"],"title":"Getting Deja Vu Right Now","uri":"/butter-dejavu/"},{"categories":["butterengine"],"content":"Mod Loading The Main class no longer holds any GLFW and is instead held in the Window class, similar to the Mesh class and BufferObjects. Mods right now hold a lot of control over what’s happening. This is still subject to change because while this was going to be a render engine, it quickly became this bigger thing and the order of events right now is: Rendering (v0.1) -\u003e ECS/Physics (v0.2) -\u003e Audio/Sound (v0.3) -\u003e Events/Mod Loading (v0.4). So we aren’t even done with v0.1 and shouldn’t worry about the specifics of this just yet. I just want to emphasize that this is a render engine before a game engine, no matter how much I want the latter.

The best solution would be to use JBullet, an outdated port of Bullet. It’s the easiest to set up and using LibGDX port while similar, has no real prebuilt support for shapes and has to be done manually. LWJGL has a binding, but with a client-server architecture which is just terrible for doing anything simple. The only problem is, it uses javax.vecmath while right now I’m using JOML. Managing both is a pain and javax.vecmath has Transform objects, similar to Unity, so I’m gonna need to refractor a lot to use vecmath.

At the time of the announcement, I knew very little about Unity, and because of how Unity works at a very high level, you either use tutorials or sit confused about it, doing nothing. Aside from that, texturing alone took forever and got me burnt out. The networking, which was promising at first, turned into a system that I was making changes to with no idea if anything was working. Essentially a programmer’s worst nightmare, being stuck in a pandamonium of whether to continue or not with something that would be a pain to debug later. I’m not completely lost on the idea. Sonic Ether’s ray tracer for Java Edition is still in early development and doesn’t use any of the fancy RTX/DLSS features or the AMD counterparts. Continuum Shaders have similar goals, like redoing the graphics engine with the latest OpenGL and then going to Vulkan later. They also plan on using the new ray tracing and upscaling features too! Google Search Console for the website clearly shows people have an interest in high fidelity, PVP clients.

One small problem though, FPS games are very mice reliant. The alternative would be to have keys on the keyboard function similar to joysticks. It also always bugged me that the only way people talked about networking movement in Mirror was through always trusting the client. This bugged me a lot. Then I remembered of The Ship. A fun, murdering delight with the remastered (Remasted) made in Unity! But no progress was made here either as it’s extremely hard to decompile and C# out of Unity 2015 due to so many issues with version compatibility that it’s not worth the hassle for anyone to do. The remastered version is broken now as no localhost connections will work despite whatever configuration. I sent an email to their support team on the issue and offered my help to fix it, but I haven’t gotten a response.
