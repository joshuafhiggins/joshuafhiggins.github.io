I‚Äôm going to be moving Butter Engine to Rust and have progressed about as far as the last blog post on the Engine, in terms of rendering. This would be the 3rd time I have redone Butter Engine, and ultimately I don‚Äôt care! Rust is forcing me to write better code for when I build off of the engine in the future and I felt that moving forward with what I have in Java would be a headache in many ways. I‚Äôll make this into it‚Äôs own post, but for right now I want to move all my workflows to Rust to learn it better. I guess that means I need to find a Hugo alternative but I‚Äôll wait another year and no blog posts for that üòâ.

I had recently watched ‚ÄúHugo in 100 seconds‚Äù by Fireship and had been looking at themes for a bit. So then instead of trying to recall what painful, voodoo witchcraft I needed to do to actually get these posts to display, (this was because I made my own theme, Jekyll is actually very cool) I switched over to Hugo and the LoveIt theme. I‚Äôll probably fork and mess around with a custom color palette, but it‚Äôs now way simpler to write a post, just do hugo new content\\posts\\postname\\index.md and write! Another reason for the move is that I won‚Äôt get security alerts for the Gemfile being out of date, Hugo isn‚Äôt included in the website repo and everything is just a mostly static webpage anyways. The theme also looks more modern than the old one, and it supports comments. I‚Äôm unsure whether or not to allow comments or if I can under GitHub pages. By the way, go check out the video.
