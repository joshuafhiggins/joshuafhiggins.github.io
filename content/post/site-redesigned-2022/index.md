Hopefully this will not be a yearly tradition of me updating the site, making one post, and leaving it untouched.

<!--more-->

I wanted to write some posts this summer, _(not really this summer more like five days ago)_, and either Jekyll wouldn’t put them into each projects’ feed or they wouldn’t show up. I had recently watched “_[Hugo in 100 seconds](https://www.youtu.be/0RKpf3rK57I)_” by [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) and had been looking at themes for a bit. So then instead of trying to recall what painful, voodoo witchcraft I needed to do to actually get these posts to display, _(this was because I made my own theme, Jekyll is actually very cool)_ I switched over to Hugo and the LoveIt theme. I’ll probably fork and mess around with a custom color palette, but it’s now way simpler to write a post, just do ```hugo new content\posts\postname\index.md``` and write! Another reason for the move is that I won’t get security alerts for the Gemfile being out of date, Hugo isn’t included in the website repo and everything is just a mostly static webpage anyways. The theme also looks more modern than the old one, and it supports comments. I’m unsure whether or not to allow comments or if I can under GitHub pages. By the way, go check out the video. The guy makes good informational content.
