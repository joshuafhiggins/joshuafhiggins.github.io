title: "Game Time"
---

Game Time is a Minecraft mod that tracks time spent in game. I have no idea where I put the downloads. Here's an excerpt from the "Catching Up & Centralizing" post on what my plans are for this: 

*"I think this would be more suited as a general-purpose desktop app that works similar to the way Steam keeps track of hours. It would also be a general-purpose, statistic-keeping app with a name change."*

As stated, this is an intresting project that I'm definitly going to revist and update.
