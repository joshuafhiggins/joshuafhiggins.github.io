title: "Left Click Counter"
---

It means what the name implies. Counts your left clicks in Minecraft. Downloads the latest release [here](https://sites.google.com/view/toasty-modding/mods/left-click-counter-mod/downloads?authuser=0) (subject to change). Here is an ecerpt from the "Catching Up & Centralizing" post about Left Click Counter mod:

*"The only thing I would change or work on with this is the system detecting left clicks. Which looking back, is not at all accurate. Although this would require me to change the updating system and as explained in [the centralizing section](/general/website/2021/08/08/general-catchingup.html#Centralizing), this probably won't happen."*

*"I would like to"*...*"Update Left Click Counter mod to use this site for updating and whatnot, but seems very easy to over-engineer and mess up the update process. So Iâ€™m going to leave it like it is for now unless I get bored and run out of projects."*
