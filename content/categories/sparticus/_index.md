Sparticus was an overly ambitious project that focused on combining ray-tracing with a Minecraft PVP client. It was going to be made in Unity and compatible with multiple Minecraft versions. There were no versions ever released. This fell through as described in the "Catching Up & Centralizing" post. Here's an excerpt:

*"Yeah ummm... got a little too ambitious with it. At the time of the announcement, I knew very little about Unity, and because of how Unity works at a very high level, you either use tutorials or sit confused about it, doing nothing. Aside from that, texturing alone took forever and got me burnt out. The networking, which was promising at first, turned into a system that I was making changes to with no idea if anything was working. Essentially a programmer's worst nightmare, being stuck in a pandamonium of whether to continue or not with something that would be a pain to debug later. I'm not completely lost on the idea. Sonic Ether's ray tracer for Java Edition is still in early development and doesn't use any of the fancy RTX/DLSS features or the AMD counterparts. Continuum Shaders have similar goals, like redoing the graphics engine with the latest OpenGL and then going to Vulkan later. They also plan on using the new ray tracing and upscaling features too! Google Search Console for the website clearly shows people have an interest in high fidelity, PVP clients."*
