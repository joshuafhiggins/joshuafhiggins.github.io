Underground Duels is a project to make an FPS game to run on my school's chromebooks. No releases were ever published. Here's an excerpt from "Catching Up & Centralizing" for more info: 

*"This project started sensibly as a way to play a deathmatch FPS on school Chromebooks and learn how to use Mirror Networking at the same time. One small problem though, FPS games are very mice reliant. The alternative would be to have keys on the keyboard function similar to joysticks. It also always bugged me that the only way people talked about networking movement in Mirror was through always trusting the client. This bugged me a lot. Then I remembered of The Ship. A fun, murdering delight with the remastered (Remasted) made in Unity! But no progress was made here either as it's extremely hard to decompile and C# out of Unity 2015 due to so many issues with version compatibility that it's not worth the hassle for anyone to do. The remastered version is broken now as no localhost connections will work despite whatever configuration. I sent an email to their support team on the issue and offered my help to fix it, but I haven't gotten a response."*
