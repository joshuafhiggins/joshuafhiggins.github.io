title: "TF2 in OpenGL & Java"
---

This is an on and off project to make TF2 in OpenGL, so I learn more about the render pipeline. The goals of this project later became what [Butter Engine](/butterengine/) was supposed to be. There are no releases availble. Here's an excerpt from "Catching Up & Centralizing" for more info: 

*"Postponed until Butter Engine is "done" read [here](\butterengine\update\programming\2021\08\07\butter-dejavu.html) on my current work with Butter Engine for more info. I followed [LearnOpenGL.com's](https://learnopengl.com) tutorial to get started on this. This was kind of my deja vu when working on Butter Engine."*
