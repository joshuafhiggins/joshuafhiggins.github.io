title: "Butter Engine"
---

Butter Engine is a game engine made in LWJGL and uses its subset libraries for various tasks. What originally started as a simple rendering library to use LWJGL easier is now becoming a fully-fledged engine and with the hope to fill the same role as Garry's Mod in end-user development.

Although similar to other projects in ambition, the hope is to work on certain parts of the TODO list at a time. For example, spending some time on rendering and then transitioning to audio, to ECS, and back.

The checklist is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/higgy999/ButterEngine).
