This site is the best place to catch up on my projects and to get the downloads for my projects when they come out. I work on various things like game development to modding Minecraft. Any project will have its own subdomain and page. If you want to talk to me personally about something, here's my [email](mailto:joshuafhiggins@gmail.com).
